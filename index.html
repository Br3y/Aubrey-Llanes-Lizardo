          <h3>HTML5 - HyperText Markup Language</h3>
          <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
            defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          <h3>CSS - Cascading Style Sheet</h3>
          <p>
            TCascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.

            Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at
            responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography,
            forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

          </a>
            <p>
              A food recipe is a set of instructions that outlines how to
              prepare and cook a specific dish or meal. It provides a detailed
              list of ingredients, along with step-by-step directions on how to
              combine and cook those ingredients to create the intended dish.
              Recipes often include information on measurements, cooking
              techniques, temperatures, and timing to ensure that the resulting
              meal is delicious and consistent. Recipes can be simple or
              complex, covering a wide range of culinary creations from basic
              dishes like scrambled eggs to elaborate gourmet meals. They serve
              as a guide for home cooks and professional chefs to replicate
              dishes with accuracy and consistency.

            <h3>Simple Landing Page</h3>
          </a>
            <p>
              A landing page is a specific web page that is designed with a
              focused and singular purpose, typically related to marketing and
              advertising campaigns. It's a page where visitors "land" after
              clicking on a link in an email, an online ad, a social media post,
              or other online sources.

            <h3>Rock Paper Scissor Game</h3>
          </a>
            <p >
              Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three
              items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as
              Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is an intransitive hand game,
              usually played between two people, in which each player
              simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched
              hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat
              hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle
              finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper
              scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently
              imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized
              form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th
              century.

              Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy that has been a popular
              and iconic children's toy for decades. It was invented by Andr√©
              Cassagnes, a French electrical technician, in the late 1950s and
              was first introduced to the market in the early 1960s by the Ohio
              Art Company. The toy consists of a red plastic frame with a gray
              screen, a pair of white knobs, and aluminum powder inside. Here's
              how it works:
